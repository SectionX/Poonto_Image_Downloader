My friend has a problem with his website. It's backend doesn't
automatically fetch images from the imported file. So he has to
download them and resized them on his computer, then upload them manually.

Can't help with the last, but I created this framework to
help him with the downloads and transformations to specification.

This program has 2 modes.
One is a script that runs from CLI or by modifying the app.py script and run it as an executable.
The other is a web API using FastAPI to be controlled from a client. (Not yet implemented)

It does it job at the moment but I want to extend it for practice.
